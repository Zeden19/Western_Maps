<h1>Favorite Points of Interest</h1>

<p>To save a selected POI as a favorite, click the "Favorite" checkbox in the selection screen.
This will save the POI into the "Favorite POIs" list in the bottom-right of the map screen.
Favorite POIs are accessible from any map, even if a different floor is selected.</p>
